# Hello friend! 🐛

<!--
**aimaewood/aimaewood** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
- 👩🏼‍🚀 I'm Aimae, a science communicator and nature enthusiast at the beginning of my web developer journey.
- 🔭 I began coding in 2011, using MATLAB, Mathematica and Javascript to solve mathematical problems during my Astrophysics degree.
- 🪐 In 2014, I completed my Masters project using IDL (a language similar to Fortran and C), to analyse data from past European Space Agency missions.
- 🎢 From 2015-2021 life took me on a wild ride that involved:
  - running my own tutoring business
  - hitch-hiking around Europe
  - operating the UK's first 3D planetarium
  - lecturing on citizen science at UCL
  - delivering live science demo and astronomy shows to thousands of people
  - working on a £multimillion project to reimagine 80 science and art exhibits for We The Curious Science Centre in Bristol.
- ✨ Whilst leading UX-testing workshops for awesome digital science exhibits, I realised I wanted to build amazing tech as well. I'd been seeking a new challenge where I could flex and develop both my logical problem solving and creative skills. Web development seemed like a great place to start!
- 🌱 I’m currently training to be a web developer and, as of November '21, am halfway through a three-month bootcamp run through the University of Bath.
- 🤔 I’m looking to chat to people in web development, data science, and anyone who applies tech solutions in cultural, environmental or medical sectors.
- 🍄 Away from the keyboard, you'll likely find me hiking in nature, training aerial hoop, or getting lost in some kind of craft.
- 💬 Ask me about wild camping, constellations, or self-taught tattooing :)
- 🌈 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌍 Based in: Bristol, UK
- 📜 How to reach me: aimaewood@gmail.com; let's chat!
