# Hello friend! 🐛

<!--
**aimaewood/aimaewood** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->
- 👩🏼‍🚀 I'm Aimae, a science communicator at the beginning of my web developer journey.
- 🔭 I began coding in 2011, using MATLAB, Mathematica and Javascript to solve mathematical problems during my Astrophysics degree.
- 🪐 In 2014, I completed my Masters project using IDL (a language similar to Fortran and C), to analyse data from past European Space Agency missions.
- 🎢 From 2015-2021 life took me on a wild ride that involved:
  - running my own tutoring business
  - hitch-hiking around Europe
  - operating the UK's first 3D planetarium
  - lecturing on citizen science at UCL
  - delivering live science demo and astronomy shows to thousands of people
  - working on a £multimillion project to reimagine seventy science and art exhibits for a renowned science centre.
- ✨ Whilst leading UX-testing workshops for awesome digital science exhibits, I realised I wanted to build amazing tech as well. I wanted a new challenge where I could flex and develop both my logical problem solving and creative skills. Web development seemed like a great place to start!
- 🌱 I’m now completing a three-month bootcamp run through the University of Bath, and will be looking for my first developer role from late January 2022. I'm enjoying learning all the tools of modern front end development, from HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS, to responsive design and CSS frameworks like Tailwind, to working with APIs and building apps using the popular React.js library.
- 🤔 I’m looking to chat to people in web development, data science, and anyone who applies tech solutions in cultural, environmental, or STEM sectors.
- 🍄 Away from the keyboard, you'll likely find me hiking in nature, training aerial hoop, or getting lost in some kind of craft.
- 💬 Ask me about wild camping, constellations, or self-taught tattooing :)
- 🌈 Pronouns: she/her
- 🌍 Based in: Bristol, UK
- 📜 How to reach me: aimaewood@gmail.com; let's chat!
